# Free Forage #

*Food Desert:  A geographic area where residentsâ€™ access to affordable, healthy food options (especially fresh fruits and vegetables) is restricted or nonexistent due to the absence of grocery stores within convenient traveling distance.*

Free forage is a web app designed to put people in food-scare areas in communication with local foodbanks, community gardens, and the like to ensure they have proper access to nutritional food no matter their locations. 

The webpage opens with a page displaying locations to access affordable, nutritious food that is nearby to the user. This is done through an interactive map with way points. By clicking on the way points, the user can see information (contact info, description, type of food, etc.) related to that waypoint. They can also help contribute to the cause by adding their own way points via the website. This data is stored on a central database, which is this displayed to all users.
